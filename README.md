# ensemblUtils
Utility scripts which use the Ensembl perl-API

Herein are a bunch of scripts that I've used of the years to perform 
various tasks with the Ensembl API.

I'm putting them here as they may be useful to others.

All require the Ensembl API is already installed and available via 
PERL5LIB. More information regarding each script is available with
the --help and --man arguments e.g.

  perl add_gene_name_column.pl --man
